### Network Engineer
I am a CCNP RS certified network engineer with former aspirations of being a backend web developer. These days I study both network engineering and programming, with an emphasis on Python and Ansible for network programmability.

Although it's been quite a few years, I developed a web application with a REST API for a friend to monitor over 800 network devices in a hotel. That allowed me to get comfortable with PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript (to a lesser extent).
